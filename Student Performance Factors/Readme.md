## Student Performance Factors

### Project Overview
In this project, you'll analyze a comprehensive database focused on various factors that impact student success, such as study habits, sleep patterns, and parental involvement. 
By crafting SQL queries, you'll investigate the relationships between these factors and exam scores, exploring questions like the effect of extracurricular activities and sleep on academic performance.
This project builds data engineering skills by enhancing your ability to manipulate and query databases effectively. 
You'll develop skills in data analysis, interpretation, and deriving insights from complex datasets, essential for making data-driven decisions in educational contexts and beyond.

### Project Description
This guided project enables you to explore the influence of various factors on student success by analyzing a comprehensive database. 
You’ll use SQL to investigate relationships between study habits, sleep patterns, and academic performance, gaining experience in data-driven educational analysis.

### Results/Findings

The result analysis are summarized as follows:
1. The data indicates a positive correlation — as study hours increase beyond 10, combined with extracurricular involvement, the average exam score improves steadily.
2. Students studying 16+ hours have the highest average score, while those studying 1-5 hours have the lowest.
3. Students with balanced sleep (6–8 hours) dominate the top ranks, whereas those with very little (<5 hours) or excessive sleep (>9 hours) are underrepresented among top performers.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

1. Encourage students to aim for 11–15 study hours per week, as this range consistently yields the highest exam performance.
2. Promote participation in extracurricular activities alongside study, as combining both leads to improved academic outcomes.
3. Educate students on the importance of balanced sleep, ideally between 6–8 hours per night, to support optimal learning and exam performance.
